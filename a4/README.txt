README:

NOTE: This must be done on a machine with Python 3 installed. Trying to run on a machine with Python 2 will cause issues
The written answers are included in the PDF submitted to the dropbox. Probability table files are included in Other.zip with the code output. 
The code output has been included directly in the PDF but the files are also here for review.

1) In order to run the program for A4, extract the zip and ensure that the .pt files are in the same directory as the Factors.py file.

2) Open a command prompt and navigate to the location of the files, then simply run the following commands:

	"python Factors.py"

NOTE: Factors.py is currently set up for Q3, part 2. There are no input parameters into Factors.py; in order to change the parameters for the inference, 
they must be changed directly in Main() within Factors.py
