README:

NOTE: This must be done on a machine with Python 3 installed. Trying to run on a machine with Python 2 will cause issues
The written answers are included in the PDF submitted to the dropbox.

1) In order to run the program for A3, extract the zip and ensure that the following files are in the same folder as the problems folder.
The directory should look like this:

	problems [folder]
	SudokuObjects.py
	SudokuSolver.py

2) Open a command prompt and navigate to the location of the files, then simply run the following commands:

	"python SudokuSolver.py problems/<folder>/<puzzle>.sd"

Where <folder> is the number of the folder (1-71) you want to user and <puzzle> is the name of the file of a particular puzzle in those folders (1-10).
